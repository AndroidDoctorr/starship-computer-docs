## Overview

### Purpose

The Enterprise Computer Simulation System is a Unity-based VR simulation designed to replicate the functionalities of the computer system aboard the starship Enterprise, as depicted in Star Trek. It aims to provide an immersive and interactive experience, simulating various aspects of the ship's operations including network management, resource allocation, device control, and user authentication.

### Key Features

-   **Futuristic Network System**: Implements a hierarchical network structure for efficient management and control of a vast array of devices.
-   **Dynamic Resource Management**: Manages computational and power resources, dynamically allocating them based on priority and demand.
-   **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Provides robust security through multi-factor authentication, integrating factors like passwords, physical location, and virtual identifiers (comm badges).
-   **Configurable Environment**: Allows for switching between different predefined configurations, including normal operation and test environments.

### High-Level Architecture

The simulation is structured around several key components, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system:

1.  **NetworkManager**: Central hub for managing network communications, including parsing network addresses and routing commands.
2.  **ResourceManager**: Oversees allocation and throttling of system resources.
3.  **UserAuthentication**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
4.  **Device Scripts**: Represent individual networked devices within the simulation.
5.  **StartupManager**: Manages the initial configuration and setup of the simulation.

Each of these components interacts with others to create a cohesive and functional simulation environment.

## Component Details

### NetworkManager

#### Description

The `NetworkManager` is responsible for managing all network-related operations within the simulation. It handles the routing of commands to devices based on network addresses and ensures that communication between devices is efficient and secure.

#### Key Functions

-   `SendCommand`: Routes commands to devices based on network addresses.
-   `RegisterDevice`: Registers devices with their respective network addresses.
-   `IsAddressMatch`: Determines whether a given device's address matches a command's target address.

### ResourceManager

#### Description

The `ResourceManager` dynamically allocates and manages the simulation's computational and power resources. It prioritizes resource distribution based on system demands and predefined priorities.

#### Key Functions

-   `AllocateResources`: Allocates resources to different systems and devices.
-   `ThrottleSystem`: Reduces resource allocation to lower-priority systems when necessary.
- 
### UserAuthentication

#### Description

The `UserAuthentication` component is responsible for the security of the system, managing the process of verifying and authenticating users within the simulation.

#### Key Functions

-   **VerifyUser**: Validates user credentials and biometric data (or VR equivalent) for authentication.
-   **AssignRoles**: Assigns roles to users, defining their access and permissions within the simulation.
-   **CheckPermissions**: Determines if a user has the necessary permissions to execute specific commands or access certain areas.

### Device Scripts

#### Description

Device Scripts represent individual networked devices within the simulation. Each script defines the behavior and functionalities of a specific device, allowing it to interact with other components of the system.

#### Key Functions

-   **ReceiveCommand**: Accepts and processes commands from the NetworkManager.
-   **ReportStatus**: Sends status updates or alerts back to the NetworkManager or ResourceManager as needed.
-   **ExecuteFunctionality**: Carries out the specific actions or operations of the device, such as adjusting settings or activating systems.

### StartupManager

#### Description

The `StartupManager` oversees the initial boot-up process of the simulation. It loads configurations, initializes various systems, and ensures that the simulation starts in a consistent and stable state.

#### Key Functions

-   **LoadConfiguration**: Reads and applies settings from configuration files or databases.
-   **InitializeSystems**: Activates and sets up different systems and components based on the loaded configuration.
-   **ManageStartupSequence**: Controls the order and manner in which various components are initialized to ensure a smooth startup.
